                <h2>Facts About Wedding Rings</h2>
                <p>
                    In all, about 70% of brides wear their rings on the fourth finger of their left hand; a tradition that comes from the Roman
                    belief that the vena amoris, or vein of love, was located there.

                    It doesn’t matter where you get the inspiration for your own wedding ceremony or traditions, what matters is that your special
                    day becomes your dream come true. That means a lot of planning and paying attention to all the details from the dress
                    and the flowers to the right wedding venue for your reception.
